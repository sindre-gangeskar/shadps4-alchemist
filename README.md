### Under development
A pre-release is out but it is bare-bones and meant for testing. 
It has the core functionality in place, enabling and disabling mods is functional as well launching games through shadPS4 Alchemist. 
Please see the releases section. 

### How does it work in terms of installing mods? 
- It renames the original file to keep things non-destructive with a prefix of an underscore "_". 
- It proceeds to create hardlinks for each file and place them where the original file is located with the same name as the original file without the prefix of "_" making it seem like it is the original file and shadPS4 will register that as the file to read

### What is a hardlink?
- A hardlink is a pointer to a file that is located elsewhere on the same drive, essentially a "shortcut"
- shadPS4 Alchemist does **not** copy over each file from the mod directory, but it creates links for each file instead
- A hardlink takes no extra space on your drive. The folder may appear larger, but the actual available drive space wonâ€™t decrease beyond the size of the mod files.
- **Making any modification to the mod file will reflect upon the link that is placed in the game's folder as well** (When said mod is enabled in shadPS4 Alchemist)
