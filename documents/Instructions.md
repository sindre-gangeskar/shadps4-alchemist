### Important
The mod files must follow the same relative paths as the game's original files, else it may
say the mod has been enabled, but the files will not have been transferred and it will not work 
even though the state says it is enabled.

Do not rename or delete any files that're related to said mod when the mod is enabled, instead disable the mod first before you do anything with the file, else unexpected things can happen and it may delete the original file in the end, potentially leading to no file at all.

### Initializing on startup
It is a requirement to have both your designated library and mods folder on the same drive.
